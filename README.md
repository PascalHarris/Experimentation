# Experimental Code

This repository is a collection of experimental code — a playground for trying out new programming techniques, exploring different languages, and generally messing around with ideas that catch my interest.

## What's Here

You'll find a mixture of languages and approaches, currently including C and AppleScript, with whatever else takes my fancy in the future. There's no particular theme or goal beyond curiosity and learning.

## Usage and Licensing

**There is no licence, copyright or obligation attached to this code.** You are completely free to use it however you wish.

That said, I have one small request: whilst you're under no obligation to attribute me if you use any of this code, I would appreciate it if you didn't claim it as your own original work. Not for any legal reason — simply because doing so would be dishonest.

## Other Repositories

If you find this sort of thing interesting, you might also enjoy some of my other projects:

- [C_Wangers](https://github.com/pascalharris/C_Wangers) — C utilities and experiments (note: this one has slightly stricter licensing terms)

## Contributing

Feel free to poke around, learn from anything useful, or point out anything spectacularly wrong. This is experimental code, so expect rough edges.
